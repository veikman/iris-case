This is an OpenSCAD design for an after-market case to fit the simplest PCB-material version of the Keebio Iris keyboard.

You will need the top half of the smallest official Keebio case to use the case presented here as a replacement for the bottom half. This design is NOT compatible with the larger official cases.

Its features are:

* Slots for two extra thumb keys per side.
* Slots for two WS2812B LEDs per side.
* Pillars supporting the main PCB.
* Mild tenting.
* A wrist rest mechanically coupled to the case.

The design was abandoned in the last days of 2017 in favour of a hand-wired keyboard project (the DMOTE). As of May 2018 it has not been printed by the author (Viktor Eikman). If you print it, expect teething troubles.

The design is licensed as per the accompanying LICENSE.txt. The author is not affiliated with Keebio.
